As more biomedical research groups have begun working remotely, online collaboration platforms such as Slack have become increasingly popular within the field of biomedical research. Despite this, there were currently no biomedical research Slack applications available. In order to bridge this gap, we developed GeneBot, a slack application that integrate various tools developed by the Ma'ayan Lab to perform gene and gene set analyses directly within Slack via interactions with a Slack bot.

**GeneBot** delivers knowledge about human genes into the Slack workspace, streamlining communication and data interpretation. By simply calling various slash commands, users can share comprehensive gene centered summaries, perform enrichment analyses, visualize gene-gene interactions networks, and test their knowledge about human genes.
