As more biomedical research groups have begun working remotely, online collaboration platforms have become increasingly popular within the field. Despite this, we noticed that there were no biomedical slack applications currently available. In order to bridge this gap, we decided to develop several slack applications that integrate various tools, some widely available and others developed by our lab. 

**GeneBot** delivers gene information and analysis tools right into your slack workspace, streamlining communication and data interpretation. By simply calling a slash command, you will be able to share comprehensive gene summaries with your channels or quiz your own gene knowledge. GeneBot can also perform gene enrichment analysis or network analysis right from slack. 

Whether you are someone who wants to learn more about genetics or a researcher who wants to share findings, GeneBot provides a powerful bioinformatics analysis tool that is both usable and integratable to the Slack workspace.
