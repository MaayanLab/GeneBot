Recently, many biomedical research teams have moved to working and collaborating remotely, and consequently, online platforms that enable team communication have become increasingly popular. Among the most widely used platforms is Slack, a team communication tool and channel-based instant-messaging app. Users of Slack are able to customize their workspace by installing Slack applications. While many biomedical researchers use Slack for their day-to-day work, there are currently no applications geared towards this field available on the Slack application directory. Here we present **GeneBot**, a Slack applications for discovering knowledge about genes directly within Slack. GeneBot listens to channel communication or slash commands to trigger the posting of information about single human genes and gene sets. Gene sets are analyzed via enrichment analysis and are connected into networks based on their known protein-protein interactions and co-expression correlations. The GeneBot application also serve as an educational tool through a quiz that facilitates users to learn gene names. Overall, GeneBot is a Slack application that enables Slack users to perform gene centered analyses directly within Slack.
