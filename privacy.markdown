This privacy policy describes what data the Slack Application GeneBot collects, what it does with that data, and what choices the users have with respect to their data.

### What data does GeneBot collect?

GeneBot collects basic data about your workspace that allows it to authenticate you with Slack. This data is purged from our servers once you uninstall GeneBot.

GeneBot does not store user-submitted data. It only sends the anonymized genes and gene sets to five other applications to perform various analyses. The following are the applications that GeneBot interacts with:
- Enrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/)
	- Enrichr stores the anonymized gene sets to ensure that the enrichment analysis links are persistent
- Genes2Networks (https://maayanlab.cloud/g2n/)
- ARCHS4 (https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/)
- Geneshot (https://maayanlab.cloud/geneshot/)
- Harmonizome (https://maayanlab.cloud/harmonizome/)

Genes2Networks, ARCHS4, Geneshot, and Harmonizome do not save any submitted data.

### How does GeneBot use the data it saves?

GeneBot only stores basic data about your workspace to ensure it can authenticate you with Slack. User-submitted genes and gene sets are anonymized and relayed to the other five applications listed above. Only one of these applications, namely Enrichr, stores the submitted data to ensure persistent links. We will never sell, trade, or provide data collected from users to any outside parties.
